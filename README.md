# Weather Bot

A simple agent powered by OpenAI that integrates with Linear to provide weather and time information. The bot can look up coordinates for cities, get current weather conditions, and provide local time information for any location. It responds to `AgentSession` webhooks from Linear and creates `AgentActivity` entries in response to prompts from users in Linear.

## Tools Available

The agent has access to three main tools:

1. **`getCoordinates(city_name)`** - Get coordinates for a city
2. **`getWeather(lat, long)`** - Get weather for given coordinates (latitude first, then longitude)
3. **`getTime(lat, long)`** - Get current time for given coordinates (latitude first, then longitude)

## Example Interactions

- "What tools do you have access to?"
- "What's the weather like in Paris?"
- "What time is it in Tokyo?"
- "Tell me about the weather and time in New York"

## Architecture

The project is built as a Cloudflare Worker with the following structure:

```
src/
├── index.ts              # Main worker entry point
├── lib/
│   ├── agent/
│   │   ├── agentClient.ts # Main agent logic
│   │   ├── tools.ts       # Tool implementations
│   │   └── prompt.ts      # Prompt provided to LLM
│   └── oauth.ts           # Linear OAuth handling
│   └── types.ts           # TypeScript type definitions
```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account
- Linear workspace with permissions to create an OAuth app
- OpenAI API key

### Cloudflare Worker Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Cloudflare environment**

   * Set your `WORKER_URL` and `LINEAR_CLIENT_ID` variables in `wrangler.jsonc`

   * Set the client secret, webhook secret, and OpenAI API key via wrangler
   ```
   wrangler secret put LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET
   wrangler secret put LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

   * Create a KV namespace
   ```
   wrangler kv namespace create "WEATHER_BOT_TOKENS"
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Linear OAuth Setup

1. Create a new OAuth app in Linear
2. Set the redirect URI to your deployed worker URL + `/oauth/callback`
3. Enable webhooks, and subscribe to agent session webhooks (and app user notification webhooks, if you'd like)
4. Copy the client ID, client secret, and webhook signing secret to use in your Cloudflare worker

## Development

### Local Development

```bash
# Start local development server
npm run dev
```

### Code Structure

## API Endpoints

- `POST /webhook` - Endpoint that receives Linear webhooks for `AgentSession` and `AgentActivity` creation
- `GET /oauth/authorize` - OAuth authorization endpoint
- `GET /oauth/callback` - OAuth callback handler

## Usage

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make changes as necessary
    - Update the tools to different ones based on your use case
    - Handle converting the agent's response into a Linear activity based on your custom prompt
    - Handle additional webhooks involving your agent
